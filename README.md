My solutions to Cracking the Coding Interview questions!

## Running C++ Example
```
g++ -std=c++17 <number>.cpp; ./a.out
```

## Running Python Examples
Some examples use pytest while others do not. I started using pytest so that I could actually see why my assertion failed!
```
python <number>.py
```
**or**
```
pytest <number>.py
```
