"""
Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some
threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be
composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.
SetOfStacks. push () and SetOfStacks. pop () should behave identically to a single stack
(that is, pop ( ) should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).

FOLLOW UP
Implement a function popAt (int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
